              It can be used by insurance companies for faster processing of
              claims if users can upload pics and the model can assess damage

            <li>
              In car insurance industry, a lot of money is being wasted on
              claims leakage. Claims leakage is the gap between the optimal and
              actual settlement of a claim.
            </li>
            <li>
              It takes a long time and result in delaying of claims processing.
              An automated system on this will be great help in speeding up the
              process.
